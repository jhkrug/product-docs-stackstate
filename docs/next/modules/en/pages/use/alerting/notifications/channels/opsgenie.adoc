== Configure Opsgenie notifications

To send notifications to Slack follow these steps:

. <<create-integration,Create an integration in OpsGenie>>
. <<create-and-test-the-channel,Create the channel>>

=== Create integration

In order to integrate SUSE Observability with OpsGenie, a global "API key" needs to be
created.  The responders for a notification can be different for each
notification and will be configured in SUSE Observability.

In Opsgenie, go to "Settings \-> Integrations".

* Click the "Add integration" button
* Search for the "API" integration type.
* Choose a name for this integration, but _do not select an Assignee team_.

When the integration has been created, it will have an "API key".

=== Create and test the channel

Select the appropriate region for your OpsGenie account and enter the "API
key".  Choose responders for the notification; _users_, _teams_, _schedules_
and _escalations_ are available for this.

Click the "Add channel" button. This adds the channel to the list of channels
on the right. It will show a "Test" button. Pressing it will generate a test
alert in OpsGenie.

== OpsGenie alerts for notifications

When a notification is opened a new OpsGenie alert is created. This message
will be updated for changes, usually only when the health state changes. When
the notification is closed the OpsGenie alert is closed again.  A note on
the alert contains the reason for closing it.+++<figure>+++image::/.gitbook/assets/k8s/notifications-opsgenie-alert-example.png[Opsgenie alert,75%]+++<figcaption>+++An OpsGenie alert generated by SUSE Observability+++</figcaption>++++++</figure>+++
