:description: SUSE Observability Self-hosted

== Overview

In case no external authentication provider can be used, you can use file based authentication. This will require every SUSE Observability user to be pre-configured in the configuration file. For every change made to a user in the configuration, SUSE Observability will automatically restart after applying the changes with Helm.

SUSE Observability includes a number of default roles, see the example configuration below. The permissions assigned to each default role and instructions on how to create other roles can be found in the xref:../rbac/role_based_access_control.adoc[Role based access control (RBAC) documentation].

== Set up file based authentication

=== Kubernetes

To configure file based authentication on Kubernetes, SUSE Observability users need to be added to the `authentication.yaml` file. For example:

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="authentication.yaml" %}

[,yaml]
----

stackstate:
  authentication:
    file:
      logins:
        - username: admin
          passwordHash: 5f4dcc3b5aa765d61d8327deb882cf99
          roles: [ stackstate-admin ]
        - username: platformadmin
          passwordHash: 5f4dcc3b5aa765d61d8327deb882cf99
          roles: [ stackstate-platform-admin ]
        - username: guest
          passwordHash: 5f4dcc3b5aa765d61d8327deb882cf99
          roles: [ stackstate-guest ]
        - username: power-user
          passwordHash: 5f4dcc3b5aa765d61d8327deb882cf99
          roles: [ stackstate-power-user ]
        - username: troubleshooter
          passwordHash: 5f4dcc3b5aa765d61d8327deb882cf99
          roles: [ stackstate-k8s-troubleshooter ]
----

{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

Follow the steps below to configure users and apply changes:

. In `authentication.yaml` - add users. The following configuration should be added for each user (see the example above):
 ** *username* - the username used to log into SUSE Observability.
 ** *passwordHash* - the password used to log into SUSE Observability. Passwords are stored as a bcrypt hash.
 ** *roles* - the list of roles that the user is a member of. The link:../rbac/rbac_permissions.adoc#predefined-roles[default SUSE Observability roles] are `stackstate-admin`,`stackstate-platform-admin`, `stackstate-power-user` and `stackstate-guest`, for details on how to create other roles, see xref:../rbac/rbac_roles.adoc[RBAC roles].
. Store the file `authentication.yaml` together with the file `values.yaml` from the SUSE Observability installation instructions.
. Run a Helm upgrade to apply the changes:
+
[,text]
----
 helm upgrade \
   --install \
   --namespace suse-observability \
   --values values.yaml \
   --values authentication.yaml \
 suse-observability \
 suse-observability/suse-observability
----

{% hint style="info" %}
*Note:*

* A bcrypt password hash can be generated using the following command line `htpasswd -bnBC 10 "" <password> | tr -d ':\n'` or using an online tool.
* The first run of the helm upgrade command will result in pods restarting, which may cause a short interruption of availability.
* Include `authentication.yaml` on every `helm upgrade` run.
* The authentication configuration is stored as a Kubernetes secret.
{% endhint %}

Follow the steps below to configure users and apply changes:

. In `authentication.yaml` - add users. The following configuration should be added for each user (see the example above):
 ** *username* - the username used to log into SUSE Observability.
 ** *password* - the password used to log into SUSE Observability. Passwords are stored as either an MD5 hash or a bcrypt hash.
 ** *roles* - the list of roles that the user is a member of. The link:../rbac/rbac_permissions.adoc#predefined-roles[default SUSE Observability roles] are `stackstate-admin`, `stackstate-platform-admin`, `stackstate-power-user`, `stackstate-k8s-troubleshooter` and `stackstate-guest`, for details on how to create other roles, see xref:../rbac/rbac_roles.adoc[RBAC roles].
. Restart SUSE Observability to apply the changes.

{% hint style="info" %}
*Note:*

* An MD5 password hash can be generated using the `md5sum` or `md5` command line applications on Linux and Mac.
* A bcrypt password hash can be generated using the following command line `htpasswd -bnBC 10 "" <password> | tr -d ':\n'` or using an online tool.
{% endhint %}
